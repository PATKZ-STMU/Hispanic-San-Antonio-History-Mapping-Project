All maps will ideally be placed within a folder labelled according to the year in which the map was published / created. The file structre should generally be: 

Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/pdfs
AND
Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/shapefiles & data

a readme should detail the origin / source of the pdfs acquired and the usage rights of each source should be copied with a link to the original copyright from the website of the provider. 

The path to this readme should be as follows:
Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/readme
