All maps will ideally be placed within a folder labelled according to the year in which the map was published / created. The file structure should generally be: 
</p>
<p>  
Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/pdfs
<\br>AND
<\br>Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/shapefiles & data
<\p>

<p>
a readme should detail the origin / source of the pdfs acquired and the usage rights of each source should be copied with a link to the original copyright from the website of the provider. 
<\p>

<p>
The path to this readme should be as follows:
<br>Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/readme
<\p>
