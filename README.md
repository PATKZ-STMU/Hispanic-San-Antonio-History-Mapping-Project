# Hispanic-San-Antonio-History-Mapping-Project

This project aims to produce an online, searchable, and user-friendly map of San Antonio's West Side and downtown are from 1870 - 1930. This project is an extension of the St. Mary's University Hispanic San Antonio Tri-Centennial Initiative. 

The data for this project will be based primarily upon Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps and City Directories, but may use other supplementary data sources and hisotric resources to accomplish its interpretive aims as well. For instance, one primary goal of this project is to attach and map digitized archival materials that contribute to the story of the Hispanic History of San Antonio.

One of the primary advantages of this project - if successful - is that it provides the ability to see archival materials in visual relation to its spatial and temporal origin. For example, users will be able to zoom into San Fernando Cathedral and select the date range "January 1, 1870 - January 1, 1888" and see all the information that has been tagged or related to that data by our contributors.

Though in its infancy, this project aims high. We hope that users and contributors understand as well as we do that this is a large undertaking fraught with the complexities of rights usage and a need for a variety of contributors in a variety of areas of expertise. However, we begin this project knowing that it will not be perfect, and provide our contributions through open license so that others - perhaps others who are more capable - may be inspired by our goals to contribute or direct our energy in a better direction. 

We hope that, as this project moves along, others will see its merits and potential. If anyone has any questions or comments, please feel free to contact the director of this project directly at:
