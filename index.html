<h1>Hispanic-San-Antonio-History-Mapping-Project</h1>
<p> This project aims to produce an online, searchable, and user-friendly map of San Antonio's West Side and downtown area from 1870 - 1930. This project is a student-led initiative which at its core is tied to the mission of the St. Mary's University Hispanic San Antonio Tri-Centennial Initiative.
  The data for this project will be based primarily upon Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps and City Directories, but may use other supplementary data resources to accomplish its interpretive aims as well. For instance, one primary goal of this project is to attach and map digitized archival materials that contribute to the story of the Hispanic History of San Antonio, meaning that a variety of materials will need to be curated and cited with the permission of institutions from within San Antonio.
  One of the primary advantages of this project - if successful - is that it provides the ability to see archival materials in visual relation to their spatial and temporal origins. For example, users will be able to zoom into San Fernando Cathedral and select the date range "January 1, 1870 - January 1, 1888" and see all the information that has been tagged or related to that data by our contributors.
Though in its infancy, this project aims high. We hope that users and contributors understand as well as we do that this is a large undertaking fraught with the complexities of rights usage and the need for a variety of contributors in a variety of areas of expertise.      However, we begin this project knowing that it will not be perfect, and provide our contributions through the MIT license so that others - perhaps others who are more capable - may be inspired by our goals to contribute to our project or direct our energy in a more productive direction. We hope that, as this project moves along, others will see its merits and potentials.
