All maps will ideally be placed within a folder labelled according to the year in which the map was published / created. The file structure should generally be: 

Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/pdfs
AND
Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/shapefiles & data

a readme should detail the origin / source of the pdfs acquired and the usage rights of each source should be copied with a link to the original copyright from the website of the provider. 

The path to this readme should be as follows:
Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps/{year of publication}/readme

The format and structure of this database is modelled after the data created by the Bexar County IT GIS team. The original source can be found <a href="http://gis-bexar.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2a73c78c51b54e97b4af51901ac3f379_0?uiTab=table">here</a>
